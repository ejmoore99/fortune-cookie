## Features

- Generate random fortune messages.
- Simple and intuitive user interface.
- Easy-to-use API integration for fortune messages.

## Technologies Used

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Fetch API for making requests
- CORS Anywhere for handling CORS issues

## API Usage

The app uses the "My Fun API" to fetch fortune messages. The API endpoint is `https://my-fun-api.onrender.com/fortune`. Due to CORS restrictions, the app utilizes the CORS Anywhere service (`https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/`) as a proxy to make requests to the API.

## Usage

To use the app, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser and click the "Generate Fortune" button to get a random fortune message.

## Additional Notes

- The app is a single-page application (SPA) and does not require any server-side processing.
- For resume purposes, this project demonstrates proficiency in front-end web development, API integration, and problem-solving skills (handling CORS issues).
- This project could be expanded by adding features such as saving favorite fortunes, sharing fortunes on social media, or incorporating more complex APIs for additional content.
